# ‚ö° Quick Fix Checklist - Settings Page Not Updating

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Webhook URL updated in Polar (was 307, now 404)
- ‚ùå **Convex HTTP routes NOT deployed** (causing 404 errors)

## The Problem
Webhooks now reaching correct URL but getting **404 Not Found** ‚Üí Endpoint not deployed to production

## The Fix (1 Step Remaining)

### ‚òëÔ∏è Step 1: Update Polar Webhook URL ‚úÖ DONE

1. Go to: `https://sandbox.polar.sh/dashboard/[your-org]/settings/webhooks`
2. Change webhook URL to:
   ```
   https://scintillating-gerbil-404.convex.site/webhooks/polar
   ```
   **CRITICAL:** Use `.convex.site` (NOT `.convex.cloud`)
3. Verify webhook secret is set
4. Save changes

### üö® Step 2: Deploy Convex Changes (DO THIS NOW)

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

**This is critical!** The HTTP routes exist in your code but aren't deployed to production yet.

## ‚úÖ Verification

After both steps:
1. Subscribe to a plan in your app
2. Check Polar webhook logs ‚Üí Should show **200** (not 307)
3. Go to `/settings` ‚Üí Should show new plan immediately

## üéØ That's It!

The webhook handler code is already correct. You just need to:
1. Point Polar to the right URL
2. Deploy the updated event handlers
