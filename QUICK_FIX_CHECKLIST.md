# ‚ö° Quick Fix Checklist - Settings Page Not Updating

## The Problem
Webhooks returning **307 redirects** ‚Üí Settings page not updating after subscription

## The Fix (2 Steps)

### ‚òëÔ∏è Step 1: Update Polar Webhook URL

1. Go to: `https://sandbox.polar.sh/dashboard/[your-org]/settings/webhooks`
2. Change webhook URL to:
   ```
   https://scintillating-gerbil-404.convex.cloud/webhooks/polar
   ```
3. Verify webhook secret is set
4. Save changes

### ‚òëÔ∏è Step 2: Deploy Convex Changes

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

## ‚úÖ Verification

After both steps:
1. Subscribe to a plan in your app
2. Check Polar webhook logs ‚Üí Should show **200** (not 307)
3. Go to `/settings` ‚Üí Should show new plan immediately

## üéØ That's It!

The webhook handler code is already correct. You just need to:
1. Point Polar to the right URL
2. Deploy the updated event handlers
