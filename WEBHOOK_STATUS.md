## What's Happening?

1. **307 Redirect** ‚Üí Polar was sending to wrong URL
   - ‚úÖ Fixed by updating webhook URL in Polar dashboard

2. **404 Not Found** ‚Üí URL is correct, but endpoint doesn't exist
   - üö® Need to deploy `convex/http.ts` to production
   - The HTTP router is in your code but not on the server yet

3. **200 OK** ‚Üí Everything working
   - ‚è≥ Will happen after deployment

---

## Next Action

Run this command to deploy the HTTP routes:

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

This will push your `convex/http.ts` file to production and register the `/webhooks/polar` endpoint.

---

## Expected Deployment Output

```
‚úì Preparing deployment
‚úì Uploading source code
‚úì Analyzing functions
‚úì Deploying to production
‚úì HTTP routes registered:
  POST /webhooks/polar
‚úì Deployment complete!
```

After this, all webhook events will return **200 OK** and your settings page will update in real-time.
