# Critical Issue: Webhook Endpoint Not Working

## Problem
- Settings page not updating after payment
- Webhook endpoint returns 404 
- URL: `https://scintillating-gerbil-404.convex.cloud/webhooks/polar`

## Root Cause
The webhook endpoint is not accessible, which means:
1. Polar webhooks are failing (404 errors)
2. No order.created or subscription.active events are processed
3. User subscription data never gets updated
4. Settings page shows old plan

## Immediate Fix Needed

The webhook URL configured in Polar dashboard is likely wrong or the HTTP router isn't working.

### Check Polar Dashboard
1. Go to Polar dashboard â†’ Webhooks
2. Current webhook URL should be: `https://scintillating-gerbil-404.convex.cloud/webhooks/polar`
3. If it's different, update it

### Test Webhook Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST https://scintillating-gerbil-404.convex.cloud/webhooks/polar \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"test","data":{}}'
```

Should return 200, not 404.

## This Explains Everything
- Polar sends webhooks to wrong/broken URL
- Gets 404 responses
- No subscription data updates
- Settings page never refreshes with new plan
- User sees old "Free" plan despite successful payment

## Fix Priority: CRITICAL
Without working webhooks, the entire subscription system is broken.
