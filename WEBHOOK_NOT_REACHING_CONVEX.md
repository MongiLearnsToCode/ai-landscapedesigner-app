# üö® Webhook Not Reaching Convex

## Problem
- Polar shows **500 error**
- Convex logs show **NO webhook activity**
- Only seeing regular app functions (users:ensureUser, redesigns:getHistory, etc.)

This means the webhook isn't reaching your Convex HTTP handler at all.

## Possible Causes

### 1. HTTP Routes Not Deployed
The `convex/http.ts` file might not be deployed to production.

**Check:**
```bash
# Redeploy to ensure HTTP routes are registered
npx convex deploy --prod
```

Look for output like:
```
‚úì HTTP routes registered:
  POST /webhooks/polar
```

### 2. Wrong Webhook URL
Double-check the exact URL in Polar settings.

**Should be:**
```
https://scintillating-gerbil-404.convex.site/webhooks/polar
```

**Common mistakes:**
- ‚ùå `.convex.cloud` instead of `.convex.site`
- ‚ùå Trailing slash: `/webhooks/polar/`
- ‚ùå Wrong path: `/polar` or `/webhook/polar`
- ‚ùå HTTP instead of HTTPS

### 3. Convex HTTP Actions Not Enabled
Verify HTTP actions are working.

**Test with curl:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://scintillating-gerbil-404.convex.site/webhooks/polar \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "data"}'
```

**Expected:** Should see logs in Convex dashboard
**If 404:** HTTP routes not deployed
**If 500:** Handler has an error

### 4. Deployment Name Changed
Verify your deployment name hasn't changed.

**Check in Convex dashboard:**
- Go to https://dashboard.convex.dev/
- Look at your deployment URL
- Should be: `scintillating-gerbil-404.convex.site`

## Immediate Actions

### Step 1: Verify Webhook URL in Polar

Go to Polar dashboard:
```
https://sandbox.polar.sh/dashboard/[your-org]/settings/webhooks
```

**Confirm the URL is EXACTLY:**
```
https://scintillating-gerbil-404.convex.site/webhooks/polar
```

### Step 2: Redeploy Convex

```bash
npx convex deploy --prod
```

Wait for completion and look for:
```
‚úì Deploying functions...
‚úì HTTP routes registered
```

### Step 3: Test with Curl

```bash
curl -v -X POST https://scintillating-gerbil-404.convex.site/webhooks/polar \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"test","id":"123","data":{}}'
```

**Check Convex logs immediately after:**
```bash
npx convex logs --prod
```

You should see:
```
"Polar webhook received: ..."
```

### Step 4: Check Convex Dashboard

1. Go to https://dashboard.convex.dev/
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Functions" tab
4. Look for `http:polarWebhook` or similar
5. If missing, HTTP routes aren't deployed

## Debugging Output

### What to Check

1. **Polar webhook URL** (screenshot or copy-paste exact URL)
2. **Convex deployment name** (from dashboard)
3. **Curl test result** (does it reach Convex?)
4. **Convex functions list** (is polarWebhook listed?)

### Expected vs Actual

**Expected in Convex logs when webhook fires:**
```
"Polar webhook received: { url: '...', method: 'POST', ... }"
"Polar webhook event received: subscription.created"
```

**Actual (current):**
```
(No webhook logs at all)
```

This confirms the webhook isn't reaching Convex.

---

## Quick Diagnostic

Run these commands and share the output:

```bash
# 1. Check deployment
npx convex deploy --prod

# 2. Test endpoint
curl -X POST https://scintillating-gerbil-404.convex.site/webhooks/polar \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"test","id":"123","data":{}}'

# 3. Check logs immediately
npx convex logs --prod --tail 20
```

If curl shows 404 ‚Üí HTTP routes not deployed
If curl shows 500 ‚Üí Handler error (but at least it's reaching Convex)
If curl shows 200 ‚Üí Webhook URL in Polar is wrong

---

## Most Likely Issue

Based on the symptoms, the most likely issue is:

**The webhook URL in Polar is incorrect or the HTTP routes aren't deployed.**

Verify:
1. URL is `.convex.site` (not `.convex.cloud`)
2. No trailing slash
3. Path is `/webhooks/polar`
4. Deployment completed successfully
